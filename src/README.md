Phase 1

- blue tribe cheers on murder, says it's justified, insurance people suck
- gray tribe decries violence
- a lot of red blue tribe also unite on that, Ben Shapiro gets roasted in comments?
  - no one really understands how insurance works

Phase 2

- suspect is caught in McDonald's. "Oh he's not our guy, he's right wing??" the tone shifts **(is this true? what happens here?)**
