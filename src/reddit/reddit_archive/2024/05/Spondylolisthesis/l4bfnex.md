Dr Stuart McGill gives solid advice on lumbar fusions vs disc replacements in an interview with [SpineXchange](https://thespinexchange.com/library/video-yfxwk-6t9hl). My notes:  


**Spine fusion vs lumbar disc replacements**

* This lumbar replacement aimed to conserve motion in the spine
* McGill’s view on motion-preservation surgery
   * McGill would never consider a disc replacement

**Cervical disc replacements far more successful per data/studies**

* L4/5, L5/S1 are highest bearing load segments
* Neck doesn’t have to tolerate as much load
* A lumbar spine in made for stability - much thicker in diameter
   * Cervical spine discs are much thinner, don’t bear compressive loads
* The lumbar disc will eventually wear out, need to be replaced
   * If someone is “successful” for 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?
   * To revise disc, difficult. Guts have to come out, lots of difficulty getting it in

  
Basically, don't try to reinvent the wheel with a first generation lumbar disc replacement that we have no long term data on.   
The loss of mobility from a one-level fusion is negligible. Pro surfer Taylor Knox had a multi-level (L4-S1) fusion when he was 15, and went on to become a top 5 surfer in the world. He's now in his 50's, still surfs like a pro and has never needed further surgery in 35+ years of professional sports.   
The risk-reward of trying to eek out an extra 5% flexibility at the cost of becoming a human guinea pig is completely unacceptable in my opinion.
