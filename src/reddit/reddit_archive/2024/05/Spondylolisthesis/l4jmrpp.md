TOPS is contraindicated for high-grade spondylolistheses: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Spondylolisthesis/comments/1cc5ob0/comment/l2015ly/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spondylolisthesis/comments/1cc5ob0/comment/l2015ly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)  
I honestly don't recall if they offer TOPS for low-grade slips (haven't followed it in some time).

Cervical disc replacements are common and highly successful, but again, I see no reason anyone would risk a lumbar disc replacement. Especially at L5/S1. Just bolt the two vertebra together. It effectively extends the tailbone by one level. The impacts are minimal.
