Yea I had L5/S1 spinal fusion 6 months ago after 1.5 years of failed conservative treatment. Within 7 days of the fusion I was on zero pain meds. (That's probably faster than most folks, but my point is just that your body isn't supposed to be in pain and need meds. Even after getting my back sliced open and my spine drilled into, I wasn't in much pain)

Everyone's spondy symptoms are different. From childhood until age 23, my back would always ache if I stood too long, but it wasn't too bad. Imo that sort of achy symptom makes sense to medicate if it's bothersome. But once the spine is unstable and you can feel the bones moving/grinding, that isn't something you try to medicate. That's something you go in and fix. I'm sure that will become standard medical knowledge in a decade, but it seems we're a bit early
