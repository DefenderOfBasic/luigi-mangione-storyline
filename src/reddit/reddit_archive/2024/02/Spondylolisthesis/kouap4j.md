**Trust your body**. If you can feel it moving, it's moving. That isn't in your head. I had the same exact sensation when I would lay in bed, or sit up. Awful.

I had the same experience with doctor's dismissing that symptom. I think it's so bizarre and horrific sounding they literally can't believe it lol.

Goods news is that feeling goes away completely after surgery once you're stabilized. Time for surgery asap and to find a doc who listens.

Invasive surgical procedures are a last-resort that should not be taken lightly, but in this case your back is broken and you can literally feel it moving. I know it's scary but someone has to tell it like it is. You'll do great.
