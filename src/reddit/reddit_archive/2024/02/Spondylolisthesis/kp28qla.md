Ah gotcha. Yea I used to get those too in my back when I would move. It wasn't nerve-related, but rather pain in my facet joints due to the instability (basically, the joints above the unstable fracture move more than they should, and the bones grind against each other which causes that zap feeling). After a few months, that went away as the joints just grew bone and became arthritic. (Now they don't hurt but they also don't move at all)
