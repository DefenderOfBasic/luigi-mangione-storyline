Because it's the year 2024, and despite the fact that we have the internet, smartphones, and spaceships - spinal care is still pretty early and basic. (We put man on the moon \~25 years before the first MRI's were in hospitals). 

I don't usually comment on posts here, but I felt compelled to with yours because it was word for word my experience with symptoms and doctors.

What do you mean by electric shocks? In your back or legs?
