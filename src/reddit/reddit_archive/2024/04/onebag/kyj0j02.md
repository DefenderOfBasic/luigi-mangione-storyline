My favorite item in my bag (and probably my favorite item that I own generally) is the [Matador Freefly16](https://www.matadorequipment.com/products/freefly16-2) packable daypack.

Imo, it's the perfect packable daypack. Of the ultralight mini-packs, it's one of the few I've found that actually has comfortable straps, is durable, holds it's shape, is rainproof, has solid water bottle pockets, packs into nothing, and doesn't look like a crumpled grocery bag.

I've used it almost daily, whether I'm traveling or at home, for two years. I've taken it on tons of hikes, gotten it drenched, and it's held up great and is the perfect size. Also use it as a gym bag, for groceries, etc. So versatile
