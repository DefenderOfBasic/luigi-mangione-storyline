Woah I didn't even know about all these. All pretty similar with some significant differences:

* Freerain 22: basically Freely 16 but 22L capacity and fully waterproof with roll top
* Beast 18: more of a hiking pack, specific hiking features, not super packable
* ReFraction 16: more minimal/universal aesthetic for hiking/city/anything, but less durable/functional for outdoors

Freefly16 is probably the best overall imo, and definitely what OP described they're looking for since it's the most packable and still solid for hikes
