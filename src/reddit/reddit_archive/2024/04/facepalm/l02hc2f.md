## Content

This is one of the crazier comment threads I've seen on reddit, that reminds me how much of an echo chamber this site is. How the hell are you being reported for merely suggesting that both "nature" and "nuture" play roles in human behavior. Literally nothing bigoted or controversial about that statement.
