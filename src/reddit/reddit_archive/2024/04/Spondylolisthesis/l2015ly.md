TOPS device is contraindicated with a grade 2/3 spondy, so not an option in your case. (The TOPS devices "replaces" the disc, and relies on the facet joints being stable / intact. With a large spondy, you're broken off your facet joints so it doesn't work). Honestly that just makes your decision easier.. do you really want to be a human guinea pig for a new medical device with no long term data anyway? Meanwhile we have 50+ years of data on spinal fusions and we know it works well in cases of instability. Don't try to reinvent the wheel.  
When you decide to go through with a fusion you'll do great
