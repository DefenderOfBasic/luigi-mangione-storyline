Couple suggestions:

1) Keep trying different surgeons. "nobody will operate on my back until iâ€™m at least 40" is nonsense coming from a medical professional who lacks perspective. If your back is broken and it's unlivable, age has nothing to do with it. Good surgeons understand this and will operate on you based on your symptoms + anatomy  
2) Tell them you are "unable to work" / do your job. We live in a capitalist society. I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life.  
3) Plan Z: fake a foot drop or piss yourself. This is nuclear option, but there comes a point where it's just ridiculous that people won't operate on your broken spine.
