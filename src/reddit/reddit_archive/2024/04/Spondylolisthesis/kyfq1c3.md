"The Doctors, a bunch of them deemed no operation is required any time soon but **basically recommended I avoid any and all physical activities outside swimming and physiotherapy**"

Bizarre yet common advice from sedentary people who don't live life to the fullest. No way to live your life as a **28 year old** and so clearly not an option, imo.

"It's simple - your spine isn't mechanically stable anymore and you should avoid any and all of these activities and running"

Should be "It's simple - your spine isn't mechanically stable anymore and you should stabilize it via PT or surgery."

If your spine is broken and unstable to the point where you can't run, do you want to be walking around with that? What are you going to wait until you take a bad fall and that instability causes some real nerve damage and you *NEED* surgery?

To be honest, once the pain becomes low-grade but all the time, it could be time for surgery. I mean the situation sucks for sure, but the solution isn't to retreat into a bubble.

Fwiw I'm 25 years old with a L5/S1 fusion. It's clear to me that the day my spondy went bad to the point where I felt it every day, I had crossed the threshold into surgery though it took me a year to realize this. Generally speaking, back surgery is a serious decision and PT is sufficient for most people, but with instability it's a different game.

Only you know in your heart what's important to you and what kind of life you want to live.
