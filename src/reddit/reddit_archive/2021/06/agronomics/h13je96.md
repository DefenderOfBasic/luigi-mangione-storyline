Yea I saw the post about New Agrarian a couple days ago. I didn't actually see the corporate presentation before it got taken down, so unless it resurfaces or someone DM's me the slides, the only info I have is the comments on the post.

Sounds like they are trying to raise more capital by reaching out to larger investors through a new company? With Agronomics' current structure, the only way they could raise more capital would be continuing to issue and dilute shares (or by selling their portfolio holdings which obv they don't want to do). But repeatedly issuing shares is a great way to piss off your shareholders. Plus who would want to buy the new issued shares if they know dilution will just keep happening every fundraise.

I think some of the comments on the New Agrarian post are overly suspicious. Jim Mellon owns 22% of Agronomics - he obviously doesn't want to tank it lol. Nor would they want to tarnish their reputations.

Definitely waiting to hear more info tho.
