You make a solid point. I'm more or less assuming that issuing more shares results in the NAV per share (basically the investment/stock price ratio you're using here) staying constant. Aka individual stock maintains the same worth/grows very slowly despite the agronomics market cap growing significantly. 

You're probably right that the NAVPS won't completely flatline with dilution - it will grow as evidenced by the most recent fundraise. 

But still, if a large private investor can invest in a separate company (New Agrarian) vs Agronomics (which will experience dilution), they're going to go with New Agrarian since growth would happen at a faster rate
