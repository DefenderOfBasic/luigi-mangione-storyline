## Content

It’s a 15 minute overview presentation, so a lot of the info overlaps with previous podcasts/presentations. I took a couple notes on things that were new/important (to me at least):

Three predictions by Jim Mellon for the next 10 years:

1. The dairy industry (milk and milk based products from cows) will be gone
   1. Already in the US, plant-based milks have risen from 0.5% to 1/5th of market in 10 years. With the 2 biggest dairy producers in US going bust
2. 50% of meat market will be gone, replaced by plant-based and cell-ag
3. 50% of fish market could be disrupted, replaced by cell-ag

Agronomics doesn’t focus on plant-based proteins - don’t believe there is sufficient intellectual property protection in this area

Total addressable market of cell-ag is 5 trillion dollars, which is larger than EV industry

Within 5 years, we could reach “Griddle Parity” (where the price of cell-ag products comes down to price of traditional products). This cost reduction due to scientific improvements and scale-up of products, *without* technological breakthroughs needed

Timeline:

* BlueNalu should be on market within this year
* Eat JUST has first cultivated chicken on market and approved for sale in Singapore

Agronomics expects to invest all of the \~63 million pounds of uninvested cash in around 9 months

In the US, meat should be on market within 2 years, while fish should be on market this year. Since fish only has one regulator (FDA) while meat has two regulators (USDA and FDA)
