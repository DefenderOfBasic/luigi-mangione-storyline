This "technical analysis" probably just plugs a few historical prices into a simple formula and outputs a result for any stock ticker. For example:

ANIC price on 2020-08-04: 0.05 GBP  
ANIC price today: 0.227 GBP  
1 year growth rate: 0.227/0.05=4.54

1-Year Forecast: 4.54 \* 0.227 = 1.03 GBP  
5-Year Forecast: 4.54 \* 5 \* 0.227 = 5.15 GBP

\^this was the simplest formula I could think of and it's not that far from their predictions...

Basically this prediction isn't bound to any actual due diligence regarding the clean meat sector and should be taken with a grain of salt
