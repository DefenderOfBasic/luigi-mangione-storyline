The TOPS surgery is a really exciting innovation for preserving spinal motion versus a fusion. Just a heads up though, the shape of the device only allows it to be installed between lumbar vertebra at L2-L5. It wouldn't be an option at the L5/S1 level as the sacrum has a different structure than a lumbar vertebra :/  


Hoping that at some point in the future, they develop a device that can be installed at L5/S1. Given that this is the most common location for isthmic spondylolisthesis, there's certainly demand for it. I can't imagine the tech is more than 5 years out
