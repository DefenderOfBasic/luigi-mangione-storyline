Sorry you've been experiencing those issues... it's certainly no fun. Glad that you've been noticing some impacts. Hopefully you can find a fix (via supplements or otherwise).

Thanks for the breakdown! Out of curiosity, why did you pick lecithin / phosphatidylcholine as your choline source (as opposed to glycerophosphocholine or betaine)? Also, interesting to see Saint Johns Wort and glycine - what's the background behind those supplements? I've seen lots about methylfolate, choline, and creatine when researching the methylation cycle, but not those other two
