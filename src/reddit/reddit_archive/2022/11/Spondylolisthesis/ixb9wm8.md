24M with long-time grade 2/3 spondy but sciatica and low back pain only starting in January of this year. I had numb right big toe and foot tingling from March to August -ish.

Still dealing with some back pain, but numbness / tingling is totally gone now. Main thing I'd say: avoid any exercises that trigger the symptoms. This doesn't mean you won't be able to resume them, but it means you can't resume until the nerves calm down / your core strengthens. A few months ago, my toe used to go completely numb anytime I walked. Yesterday I did a 10 mile hike without issue

Imo you should certainly be able to continue weight-lifting, but being careful with your routine. Strengthening your core and back can actually help take pressure off your spine/spondy. At a grade 1 I bet you have a solid chance at avoiding fusion, or pushing it off a decade plus.
