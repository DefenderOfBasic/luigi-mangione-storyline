Thanks for explaining this! I was curious why you would want to fuse more than one level, but given the retrolisthesis at L4 that makes sense.

Glad you were able to get multiple opinions and take the approach that was right for you. Hope you are progressing well in your recovery!

With a grade 2/3 at 24 y.o. and near-constant burning/twitching in both ankles/calves since March, I don't see myself avoiding this for too long lol. But just trying to learn as much as I can before the surgery comes.
