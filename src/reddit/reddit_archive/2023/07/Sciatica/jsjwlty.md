Stuck being sedentary when you're an energetic person and used to being so active is one of the worst aspects of sciatica.

But there are still ways to keep your mind and body active while you heal! I spent a lot of time doing yoga (being mindful of avoiding certain postures), which was very different for me than my typical routine of weightlifting and martial arts, but I actually have learned a lot and didn't mind the transition at all. I also switched my workouts to static core exercises and built up a six pack despite not being able to use a barbell for months.

Basically, there are still options! Using your body however it is currently capable will not only be critical for your mental health, but also helpful in speeding your recovery. You don't want to fall into a cycle of becoming too sedentary - nor do you have to! There are always some activities that fall between \*your normal routine\* and \*nothing\*, even if it initially feels like the only option is being sedentary

Hope that helps and sorry you have to go through this
