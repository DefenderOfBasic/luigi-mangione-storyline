You are not crazy. If you have spondy and sciatica that is impacting your quality of life this much, it may be time. This is a structural problem that will likely only get worse with time. The good news? We live in 2023 with access to modern medicine. Imo, it's not worth being so afraid of more pain/fusions down the line that you don't live your life now.

I got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20's and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it

Surgery is not a 100% guarantee, but that's not something we can control. And once it hits this bad, we probably have to do it anyway. With axial back pain only, it's probably safe to wait until it's unbearable. With sciatica as a symptom, sooner can only be better imo
