Yea when I went surfing 1.5 years ago, I experienced sciatica for the first time. Basically the extension movement destabilized my spondy. A few weeks later I slipped on a piece of paper and my right glute locked and right leg shut down for a week. Couldn't support any weight on it. Eventually calmed down but the stability was compromised and the glute keeps things in place I guess.

It's all a system, so it's important to keep everything strong and moving smoothly
