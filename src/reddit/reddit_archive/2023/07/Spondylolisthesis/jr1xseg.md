Core workouts, lots of walking, and avoid sitting.

I'm pretty athletic, but haven't done any active sports in the last year - I've been rehabbing with lots of core work. Though I just scheduled surgery for two weeks from now. It's clear to me at this point that while my body can do a lot, it cannot re-stabilize this fracture. Looking forward to being on the side of recovery. With a single-level fusion, there's no reason athletics would be restricted and at this point I pretty much just gotta do it
