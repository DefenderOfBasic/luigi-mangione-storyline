My right hip has been locked for the last 1.5 years. Hurts when I sit down and my leg muscles start twitching, also sometimes this would cause the tingling butt/groin. Also noticed that sometimes when I would stand, twisted maybe 10 degrees to the right it would trigger those same symptoms

I got it loosened up once or twice, but tbh when you're this unstable things lock up for a reason - to provide stability and protect the nerves.
