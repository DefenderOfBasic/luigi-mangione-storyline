Yea I have a 2cm clip at L5/S1. Going in for fusion on Friday.

Per your MRI, agreed that you don't have terrible nerve compression at L5/S1. Plus, the nerves that go to the bladder/bowel are sacral (S2-S4 I believe?). Do your hips or back feel tight? Your nerve compression might be coming from elsewhere. That said, you might still need the fusion, but it's hard to directly correlate L5/S1 to your bladder issues. It's probably a related compensation elsewhere
