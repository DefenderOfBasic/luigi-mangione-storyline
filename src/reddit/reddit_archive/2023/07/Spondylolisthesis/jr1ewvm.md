25M. I have this. Started when I first aggravated my spondy 1.5 years ago after surfing. My back and hips locked up after the accident, and my whole lumbar / hips have been out of wack since then - something is probably putting pressure on the sacral nerves that innervate the groin/butt.

Not cauda equina

If there is anything tight in your hips, maybe check that out with a PT? Not to scare you, but as of last week this intermittent numbness has become constant. I'm terrified of the implications bc well
