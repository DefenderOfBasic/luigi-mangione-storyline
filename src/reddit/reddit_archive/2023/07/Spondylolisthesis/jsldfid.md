Thanks!
Have you spoken to a surgeon that said the bowel / bladder issues would resolve with fusion? Just asking because L5/S1 doesn’t innervate the bladder from what I understand. So decompressing those nerves wouldn’t clearly lead to relief. That said, getting stability may allow you to fix your hips / whatever else is causing your problems
