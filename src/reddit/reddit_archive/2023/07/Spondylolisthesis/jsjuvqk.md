Hey twin. (Bladder and genital pain for the last year on and off after injuring my spondy. Also had back pain, sciatica etc). This happened to me two weeks ago - started to have numbness in my groin/bladder and into my right leg below the knee. In my case, it is due to my piriformis / hip muscles tightening to compensate for my injury. The tightness squeezes my nerves. It doesn't show up on MRI and no doc has really confirmed it, but when I sit I feel the piriformis tighten and sensation into the groin and leg.

As simple as it sounds - have you seen a solid PT and tried really stretching your glutes and hips? 

Your MRI looks pretty good, which is good news. You don't have cauda equina. But the symptoms you're describing suck, and are 100% real.
