Glad to hear! You'll definitely be able to keep up your active life with the right mentality and the right PT/surgery.

One thing I'll say - with all the success stories vs horror stories, you definitely start to see trends. Basically, if symptoms are limited to back pain, and annoying but manageable - PT can do \*wonders\* and surgery is probably unwarranted. When neurological symptoms begin or back pain becomes relentless (sitting, standing, basic activities become painful), the successful stories head into surgery within a few weeks/months of no improvement. Surgery is scary, but it's 2023 and is highly successful.  


In my case I had surgery 2 weeks ago because I had nerve issues. Surgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds. Can sit, walk, stand as long as I want and I don't even feel the fusion. Obviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated
