I never understood the "too young for a fusion" logic. Your spine is fractured and the structural security of your spine is compromised. When someone breaks their leg, are they "too young" for surgery? I suppose you're "too young" to have back pain, but that doesn't change the fact that you do.

That said, whether a fusion is right for you is your decision and depends on severity of your pain. But once the disc goes bad in the 20s/30s/40s for many people, the spondy crosses a tipping point, destabilizes and seriously impacts quality of life. Sounds like that happened to you a year ago. My personal opinion: once you've tried steroid shots and nerve ablations and you start going on reddit and making comments like this, it's time.

For context, I'm 25. my spondy went bad 1.5 years ago when I was 23. Had L5/S1 fusion 3 months ago. I may be an outlier, but at day 8 I was taking zero pain meds and haven't had a bad day since. I even had an open TLIF as opposed to the newer minimally invasive surgeries. The surgery wasn't nearly as scary as I made it out to be in my head, and I knew it was the right decision within a week, and that I won't have to bother with injections or future surgery for many years. Remember that the human body is supposed to exist in a pain-free state. Constant pain means something is wrong. Even with metal in my back, I'm not in pain.

Sorry you're also a member of this shitty club, but know that you'll be fine whatever you decide
