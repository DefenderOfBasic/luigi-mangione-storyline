I 100% contracted Lyme (was tested and treated immediately) when I was 13.

I was then tested again this year given my symptoms. I just looked back at these tests, and the only one for Lyme is called "Lyme AB Screen," which I assume isn't terribly specific. I will definitely look into more comprehensive testing.

What do you mean by "after it was too late?"
