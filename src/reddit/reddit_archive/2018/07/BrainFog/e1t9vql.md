Heyo. I'm a 20 year old male, and I've been experiencing similar symptoms since I was 15. I'm also a very critical/logical thinker (I study CS and Bio). It's truly incredible how accurately your bowling ball example describes me. My symptoms were very minor at first and I was able to excel in high school, but the symptoms worsened exponentially last year after my fraternity's (very tame) "hell week." I simply wasn't able to recover from a week of disturbed sleep.

I'll try to come back to this and add more to this comment later, but in case I forget I want to at least say this:
It's absolutely brutal to have such a life-halting issue, especially since the issue itself wears down the critical/logical thinking mind you'd usually use to tackle it. The people around you probably won't understand your symptoms- they certainly don't for me. As each test comes back negative, the doctors won't have a fucking clue what's going on.

I'm sure you already know most of this, but basically I just want to say that you're not alone. Stay strong. If you ever want to talk, I'm sure there's a lot we can learn from each other's stories.
