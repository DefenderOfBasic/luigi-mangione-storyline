If you decide to start gaming again, I'd recommend you find a short game with ~10-15 hours of gameplay. Test out whether you're able to play for only a few hours at a time, or whether you simply can't stop once you start.

You won't run the risk of getting sucked into the game and ruining the life you've built - if you get sucked in, the game will be over before you know it. Then, you can decide it simply isn't possible to play games casually.

Edit: Personally, I agree with you. I find it impossible to play games for an hour at a time. It's hardly enjoyable to game in such small doses. When I play games, I have to set aside literal days to do nothing but just play. Once those days are up, I stop completely and don't play again for a few weeks. This solution works for me, but as you said, it's still playing with fire
