3 biggest things that help me on exams:

1) Have a list of the major topic categories: BFS/DFS, SCC/Kosaraju/toposort, MST, shortest paths, greedy algs. It's safe to assume there will be roughly one question from each category. If you're stuck on a question, see which of these categories you haven't encountered yet

2) Have a list of common runtimes and the algorithms associated with those runtimes. See O(m+n) on question 1a)? List out BFS/DFS/toposort/Kosaraju's and see if any of those help you.

3) Know the in's and out's of each algorithm's runtime: Why is Kruskal's O(m log m)? Knowing the runtime specifics, how does this change if the edges are already sorted? When you see a question like 1b) you can notice how it's similar to Bellman Ford and, understanding the origin of the VE runtime, manipulate the alg to fit the constraints

Granted, I did pretty poorly on this exam too, so take my advice with a grain of salt
