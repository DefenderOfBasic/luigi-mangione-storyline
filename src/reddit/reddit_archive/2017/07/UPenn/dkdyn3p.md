I'm a bit late but...
I had a pretty similar schedule my first semester (same thing but I had writing sem and ECON 001 instead of ESE and music). It was definitely tough, but manageable.

If you want, you can switch one of your math/engineering courses for something easier, but if you plan on doing EE and CIS then this is a pretty standard semester in terms of difficulty
