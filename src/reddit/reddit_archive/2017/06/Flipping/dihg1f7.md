Read the beginner's guide last week and went to my first garage sale this weekend:


HP Officejet Pro 8500 printer - loaded w/ ink and w/ extra cartridges for $25 ($75-$100) 

Linksys AC1200 max wifi extender for $5 ($60)

RobotiKits super solar racing car for $1 ($8)

Mighty mouse 1966 cartoon movie for $1 ($10)

Sony watchman for free ($8)

Three CoD/Halo games for $3 each ($7-10 each)


The estimates are based off previously sold ebay listings.
Thanks for the help!
