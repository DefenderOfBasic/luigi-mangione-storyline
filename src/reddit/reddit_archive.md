TOPS is contraindicated for high-grade spondylolistheses: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Spondylolisthesis/comments/1cc5ob0/comment/l2015ly/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spondylolisthesis/comments/1cc5ob0/comment/l2015ly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spondylolisthesis/comments/1cc5ob0/comment/l2015ly/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spondylolisthesis/comments/1cc5ob0/comment/l2015ly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button))  
I honestly don't recall if they offer TOPS for low-grade slips (haven't followed it in some time).

Cervical disc replacements are common and highly successful, but again, I see no reason anyone would risk a lumbar disc replacement. Especially at L5/S1. Just bolt the two vertebra together. It effectively extends the tailbone by one level. The impacts are minimal.

The loss of mobility after a 1-level spinal fusion is negligible. This is 35 years after a 2-level: [[https://www.instagram.com/taylor\_knox/](https://www.instagram.com/taylor_knox/](https://www.instagram.com/taylor\_knox/](https://www.instagram.com/taylor_knox/))

## Content

Dr Stuart McGill gives solid advice on lumbar fusions vs disc replacements in an interview with [SpineXchange](https://thespinexchange.com/library/video-yfxwk-6t9hl). My notes:  


**Spine fusion vs lumbar disc replacements**

* This lumbar replacement aimed to conserve motion in the spine
* McGill’s view on motion-preservation surgery
   * McGill would never consider a disc replacement

**Cervical disc replacements far more successful per data/studies**

* L4/5, L5/S1 are highest bearing load segments
* Neck doesn’t have to tolerate as much load
* A lumbar spine in made for stability - much thicker in diameter
   * Cervical spine discs are much thinner, don’t bear compressive loads
* The lumbar disc will eventually wear out, need to be replaced
   * If someone is “successful” for 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?
   * To revise disc, difficult. Guts have to come out, lots of difficulty getting it in

  
Basically, don't try to reinvent the wheel with a first generation lumbar disc replacement that we have no long term data on.   
The loss of mobility from a one-level fusion is negligible. Pro surfer Taylor Knox had a multi-level (L4-S1) fusion when he was 15, and went on to become a top 5 surfer in the world. He's now in his 50's, still surfs like a pro and has never needed further surgery in 35+ years of professional sports.   
The risk-reward of trying to eek out an extra 5% flexibility at the cost of becoming a human guinea pig is completely unacceptable in my opinion.

TOPS device is contraindicated with a grade 2/3 spondy, so not an option in your case. (The TOPS devices "replaces" the disc, and relies on the facet joints being stable / intact. With a large spondy, you're broken off your facet joints so it doesn't work). Honestly that just makes your decision easier.. do you really want to be a human guinea pig for a new medical device with no long term data anyway? Meanwhile we have 50+ years of data on spinal fusions and we know it works well in cases of instability. Don't try to reinvent the wheel.  
When you decide to go through with a fusion you'll do great

Couple suggestions:

1. Keep trying different surgeons. "nobody will operate on my back until i’m at least 40" is nonsense coming from a medical professional who lacks perspective. If your back is broken and it's unlivable, age has nothing to do with it. Good surgeons understand this and will operate on you based on your symptoms + anatomy
2. Tell them you are "unable to work" / do your job. We live in a capitalist society. I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life.
3. Plan Z: fake a foot drop or piss yourself. This is the absolute nuclear option, but there comes a point where it's just ridiculous that people won't operate on your broken spine.

Woah I didn't even know about all these. All pretty similar with some significant differences:

* Freerain 22: basically Freely 16 but 22L capacity and fully waterproof with roll top
* Beast 18: more of a hiking pack, specific hiking features, not super packable
* ReFraction 16: more minimal/universal aesthetic for hiking/city/anything, but less durable/functional for outdoors

Freefly16 is probably the best overall imo, and definitely what OP described they're looking for since it's the most packable and still solid for hikes

My favorite item in my bag (and probably my favorite item that I own generally) is the [Matador Freefly16](https://www.matadorequipment.com/products/freefly16-2) packable daypack.

Imo, it's the perfect packable daypack. Of the ultralight mini-packs, it's one of the few I've found that actually has comfortable straps, is durable, holds it's shape, is rainproof, has solid water bottle pockets, packs into nothing, and doesn't look like a crumpled grocery bag.

I've used it almost daily, whether I'm traveling or at home, for two years. I've taken it on tons of hikes, gotten it drenched, and it's held up great and is the perfect size. Also use it as a gym bag, for groceries, etc. So versatile

"The Doctors, a bunch of them deemed no operation is required any time soon but **basically recommended I avoid any and all physical activities outside swimming and physiotherapy**"

Bizarre yet common advice from sedentary people who don't live life to the fullest. No way to live your life as a **28 year old** and so clearly not an option, imo.

"It's simple - your spine isn't mechanically stable anymore and you should avoid any and all of these activities and running"

Should be "It's simple - your spine isn't mechanically stable anymore and you should stabilize it via PT or surgery."

If your spine is broken and unstable to the point where you can't run, do you want to be walking around with that? What are you going to wait until you take a bad fall and that instability causes some real nerve damage and you *NEED* surgery?

To be honest, once the pain becomes low-grade but all the time, it could be time for surgery. I mean the situation sucks for sure, but the solution isn't to retreat into a bubble.

Fwiw I'm 25 years old with a L5/S1 fusion. It's clear to me that the day my spondy went bad to the point where I felt it every day, I had crossed the threshold into surgery though it took me a year to realize this. Generally speaking, back surgery is a serious decision and PT is sufficient for most people, but with instability it's a different game.

Only you know in your heart what's important to you and what kind of life you want to live.

Yea I had L5/S1 spinal fusion 6 months ago after 1.5 years of failed conservative treatment. Within 7 days of the fusion I was on zero pain meds. (That's probably faster than most folks, but my point is just that your body isn't supposed to be in pain and need meds. Even after getting my back sliced open and my spine drilled into, I wasn't in much pain)

Everyone's spondy symptoms are different. From childhood until age 23, my back would always ache if I stood too long, but it wasn't too bad. Imo that sort of achy symptom makes sense to medicate if it's bothersome. But once the spine is unstable and you can feel the bones moving/grinding, that isn't something you try to medicate. That's something you go in and fix. I'm sure that will become standard medical knowledge in a decade, but it seems we're a bit early

Ah gotcha. Yea I used to get those too in my back when I would move. It wasn't nerve-related, but rather pain in my facet joints due to the instability (basically, the joints above the unstable fracture move more than they should, and the bones grind against each other which causes that zap feeling). After a few months, that went away as the joints just grew bone and became arthritic. (Now they don't hurt but they also don't move at all)

Because it's the year 2024, and despite the fact that we have the internet, smartphones, and spaceships - spinal care is still pretty early and basic. (We put man on the moon \~25 years before the first MRI's were in hospitals). 

I don't usually comment on posts here, but I felt compelled to with yours because it was word for word my experience with symptoms and doctors.

What do you mean by electric shocks? In your back or legs?

**Trust your body**. If you can feel it moving, it's moving. That isn't in your head. I had the same exact sensation when I would lay in bed, or sit up. Awful.

I had the same experience with doctor's dismissing that symptom. I think it's so bizarre and horrific sounding they literally can't believe it lol.

Goods news is that feeling goes away completely after surgery once you're stabilized. Time for surgery asap and to find a doc who listens.

Invasive surgical procedures are a last-resort that should not be taken lightly, but in this case your back is broken and you can literally feel it moving. I know it's scary but someone has to tell it like it is. You'll do great.

## Content

I never understood the "too young for a fusion" logic. Your spine is fractured and the structural security of your spine is compromised. When someone breaks their leg, are they "too young" for surgery? I suppose you're "too young" to have back pain, but that doesn't change the fact that you do.

That said, whether a fusion is right for you is your decision and depends on severity of your pain. But once the disc goes bad in the 20s/30s/40s for many people, the spondy crosses a tipping point, destabilizes and seriously impacts quality of life. Sounds like that happened to you a year ago. My personal opinion: once you've tried steroid shots and nerve ablations and you start going on reddit and making comments like this, it's time.

For context, I'm 25. my spondy went bad 1.5 years ago when I was 23. Had L5/S1 fusion 3 months ago. I may be an outlier, but at day 8 I was taking zero pain meds and haven't had a bad day since. I even had an open TLIF as opposed to the newer minimally invasive surgeries. The surgery wasn't nearly as scary as I made it out to be in my head, and I knew it was the right decision within a week, and that I won't have to bother with injections or future surgery for many years. Remember that the human body is supposed to exist in a pain-free state. Constant pain means something is wrong. Even with metal in my back, I'm not in pain.

Sorry you're also a member of this shitty club, but know that you'll be fine whatever you decide

Glad to hear! You'll definitely be able to keep up your active life with the right mentality and the right PT/surgery.

One thing I'll say - with all the success stories vs horror stories, you definitely start to see trends. Basically, if symptoms are limited to back pain, and annoying but manageable - PT can do \*wonders\* and surgery is probably unwarranted. When neurological symptoms begin or back pain becomes relentless (sitting, standing, basic activities become painful), the successful stories head into surgery within a few weeks/months of no improvement. Surgery is scary, but it's 2023 and is highly successful.  


In my case I had surgery 2 weeks ago because I had nerve issues. Surgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds. Can sit, walk, stand as long as I want and I don't even feel the fusion. Obviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated

Thanks!
Have you spoken to a surgeon that said the bowel / bladder issues would resolve with fusion? Just asking because L5/S1 doesn’t innervate the bladder from what I understand. So decompressing those nerves wouldn’t clearly lead to relief. That said, getting stability may allow you to fix your hips / whatever else is causing your problems

Yea I have a 2cm clip at L5/S1. Going in for fusion on Friday.

Per your MRI, agreed that you don't have terrible nerve compression at L5/S1. Plus, the nerves that go to the bladder/bowel are sacral (S2-S4 I believe?). Do your hips or back feel tight? Your nerve compression might be coming from elsewhere. That said, you might still need the fusion, but it's hard to directly correlate L5/S1 to your bladder issues. It's probably a related compensation elsewhere

Stuck being sedentary when you're an energetic person and used to being so active is one of the worst aspects of sciatica.

But there are still ways to keep your mind and body active while you heal! I spent a lot of time doing yoga (being mindful of avoiding certain postures), which was very different for me than my typical routine of weightlifting and martial arts, but I actually have learned a lot and didn't mind the transition at all. I also switched my workouts to static core exercises and built up a six pack despite not being able to use a barbell for months.

Basically, there are still options! Using your body however it is currently capable will not only be critical for your mental health, but also helpful in speeding your recovery. You don't want to fall into a cycle of becoming too sedentary - nor do you have to! There are always some activities that fall between \*your normal routine\* and \*nothing\*, even if it initially feels like the only option is being sedentary

Hope that helps and sorry you have to go through this

Hey twin. (Bladder and genital pain for the last year on and off after injuring my spondy. Also had back pain, sciatica etc). This happened to me two weeks ago - started to have numbness in my groin/bladder and into my right leg below the knee. In my case, it is due to my piriformis / hip muscles tightening to compensate for my injury. The tightness squeezes my nerves. It doesn't show up on MRI and no doc has really confirmed it, but when I sit I feel the piriformis tighten and sensation into the groin and leg.

As simple as it sounds - have you seen a solid PT and tried really stretching your glutes and hips? 

Your MRI looks pretty good, which is good news. You don't have cauda equina. But the symptoms you're describing suck, and are 100% real.

If both legs are going numb and you have severe stenosis, then it sounds like it's time for surgery.. Surgery is scary, but the sooner you get past this, the better. Good luck with the neurosurgeon consult!

All depends on your spine. Do you know what triggers the pain and numbness? Standing, sitting, laying down, bending forward or backwards?

You'll do great, whatever you decide. Agreed - we have a structural issue with a clear surgical indication that these surgeons do for a living.

Core workouts, lots of walking, and avoid sitting.

I'm pretty athletic, but haven't done any active sports in the last year - I've been rehabbing with lots of core work. Though I just scheduled surgery for two weeks from now. It's clear to me at this point that while my body can do a lot, it cannot re-stabilize this fracture. Looking forward to being on the side of recovery. With a single-level fusion, there's no reason athletics would be restricted and at this point I pretty much just gotta do it

Yea when I went surfing 1.5 years ago, I experienced sciatica for the first time. Basically the extension movement destabilized my spondy. A few weeks later I slipped on a piece of paper and my right glute locked and right leg shut down for a week. Couldn't support any weight on it. Eventually calmed down but the stability was compromised and the glute keeps things in place I guess.

It's all a system, so it's important to keep everything strong and moving smoothly

My right hip has been locked for the last 1.5 years. Hurts when I sit down and my leg muscles start twitching, also sometimes this would cause the tingling butt/groin. Also noticed that sometimes when I would stand, twisted maybe 10 degrees to the right it would trigger those same symptoms

I got it loosened up once or twice, but tbh when you're this unstable things lock up for a reason - to provide stability and protect the nerves.

25M. I have this. Started when I first aggravated my spondy 1.5 years ago after surfing. My back and hips locked up after the accident, and my whole lumbar / hips have been out of wack since then - something is probably putting pressure on the sacral nerves that innervate the groin/butt.

Not cauda equina

If there is anything tight in your hips, maybe check that out with a PT? Not to scare you, but as of last week this intermittent numbness has become constant. I'm terrified of the implications bc well

You are not crazy. If you have spondy and sciatica that is impacting your quality of life this much, it may be time. This is a structural problem that will likely only get worse with time. The good news? We live in 2023 with access to modern medicine. Imo, it's not worth being so afraid of more pain/fusions down the line that you don't live your life now.

I got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20's and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it

Surgery is not a 100% guarantee, but that's not something we can control. And once it hits this bad, we probably have to do it anyway. With axial back pain only, it's probably safe to wait until it's unbearable. With sciatica as a symptom, sooner can only be better imo

24M with long-time grade 2/3 spondy but sciatica and low back pain only starting in January of this year. I had numb right big toe and foot tingling from March to August -ish.

Still dealing with some back pain, but numbness / tingling is totally gone now. Main thing I'd say: avoid any exercises that trigger the symptoms. This doesn't mean you won't be able to resume them, but it means you can't resume until the nerves calm down / your core strengthens. A few months ago, my toe used to go completely numb anytime I walked. Yesterday I did a 10 mile hike without issue

Imo you should certainly be able to continue weight-lifting, but being careful with your routine. Strengthening your core and back can actually help take pressure off your spine/spondy. At a grade 1 I bet you have a solid chance at avoiding fusion, or pushing it off a decade plus.

Sorry you've been experiencing those issues... it's certainly no fun. Glad that you've been noticing some impacts. Hopefully you can find a fix (via supplements or otherwise).

Thanks for the breakdown! Out of curiosity, why did you pick lecithin / phosphatidylcholine as your choline source (as opposed to glycerophosphocholine or betaine)? Also, interesting to see Saint Johns Wort and glycine - what's the background behind those supplements? I've seen lots about methylfolate, choline, and creatine when researching the methylation cycle, but not those other two

How's the trial run going so far? I just stumbled on the choline calculator and it recommended 9 egg yolks per day (80% decrease methylfolate score). I'm heterozygous for 3/5 and homozygous for the other 2/5 SNPs 😅... Wondering if I should try out some sort of choline supplementation

Thanks for explaining this! I was curious why you would want to fuse more than one level, but given the retrolisthesis at L4 that makes sense.

Glad you were able to get multiple opinions and take the approach that was right for you. Hope you are progressing well in your recovery!

With a grade 2/3 at 24 y.o. and near-constant burning/twitching in both ankles/calves since March, I don't see myself avoiding this for too long lol. But just trying to learn as much as I can before the surgery comes.

Just curious, why did you decide to go with the two-level PLIF over the single level fusion? I've also spoken to two different surgeons and gotten those two different recommendations (not considering surgery right now, but these are the approaches they would take if/when the time comes)

The TOPS surgery is a really exciting innovation for preserving spinal motion versus a fusion. Just a heads up though, the shape of the device only allows it to be installed between lumbar vertebra at L2-L5. It wouldn't be an option at the L5/S1 level as the sacrum has a different structure than a lumbar vertebra :/  


Hoping that at some point in the future, they develop a device that can be installed at L5/S1. Given that this is the most common location for isthmic spondylolisthesis, there's certainly demand for it. I can't imagine the tech is more than 5 years out

This "technical analysis" probably just plugs a few historical prices into a simple formula and outputs a result for any stock ticker. For example:

ANIC price on 2020-08-04: 0.05 GBP  
ANIC price today: 0.227 GBP  
1 year growth rate: 0.227/0.05=4.54

1-Year Forecast: 4.54 \* 0.227 = 1.03 GBP  
5-Year Forecast: 4.54 \* 5 \* 0.227 = 5.15 GBP

\^this was the simplest formula I could think of and it's not that far from their predictions...

Basically this prediction isn't bound to any actual due diligence regarding the clean meat sector and should be taken with a grain of salt

You make a solid point. I'm more or less assuming that issuing more shares results in the NAV per share (basically the investment/stock price ratio you're using here) staying constant. Aka individual stock maintains the same worth/grows very slowly despite the agronomics market cap growing significantly. 

You're probably right that the NAVPS won't completely flatline with dilution - it will grow as evidenced by the most recent fundraise. 

But still, if a large private investor can invest in a separate company (New Agrarian) vs Agronomics (which will experience dilution), they're going to go with New Agrarian since growth would happen at a faster rate

## Content

It’s a 15 minute overview presentation, so a lot of the info overlaps with previous podcasts/presentations. I took a couple notes on things that were new/important (to me at least):

Three predictions by Jim Mellon for the next 10 years:

1. The dairy industry (milk and milk based products from cows) will be gone
   1. Already in the US, plant-based milks have risen from 0.5% to 1/5th of market in 10 years. With the 2 biggest dairy producers in US going bust
2. 50% of meat market will be gone, replaced by plant-based and cell-ag
3. 50% of fish market could be disrupted, replaced by cell-ag

Agronomics doesn’t focus on plant-based proteins - don’t believe there is sufficient intellectual property protection in this area

Total addressable market of cell-ag is 5 trillion dollars, which is larger than EV industry

Within 5 years, we could reach “Griddle Parity” (where the price of cell-ag products comes down to price of traditional products). This cost reduction due to scientific improvements and scale-up of products, *without* technological breakthroughs needed

Timeline:

* BlueNalu should be on market within this year
* Eat JUST has first cultivated chicken on market and approved for sale in Singapore

Agronomics expects to invest all of the \~63 million pounds of uninvested cash in around 9 months

In the US, meat should be on market within 2 years, while fish should be on market this year. Since fish only has one regulator (FDA) while meat has two regulators (USDA and FDA)

Yea I saw the post about New Agrarian a couple days ago. I didn't actually see the corporate presentation before it got taken down, so unless it resurfaces or someone DM's me the slides, the only info I have is the comments on the post.

Sounds like they are trying to raise more capital by reaching out to larger investors through a new company? With Agronomics' current structure, the only way they could raise more capital would be continuing to issue and dilute shares (or by selling their portfolio holdings which obv they don't want to do). But repeatedly issuing shares is a great way to piss off your shareholders. Plus who would want to buy the new issued shares if they know dilution will just keep happening every fundraise.

I think some of the comments on the New Agrarian post are overly suspicious. Jim Mellon owns 22% of Agronomics - he obviously doesn't want to tank it lol. Nor would they want to tarnish their reputations.

Definitely waiting to hear more info tho.

If you're trading AGNMF from the US, I'd recommend using E\*TRADE due to the low fees. E\*TRADE only charges $6.95 per trade (penny stock trades fee). Fidelity, on the other hand, charges a $50 foreign settlement fee per trade.

## Content

Thanks. Working through the degree has certainly been tougher than anything I ever even thought I could handle. Granted, I went from almost entirely A’s at a tough school to just passing my classes and not understanding anything while putting in probably twice the amount of work.

There were quite a few times I considered dropping, but ultimately I decided that dropping would be much worse. The days when I don’t have any work seem to be the worst. Struggling to understand lectures and homeworks is difficult, but having the same level of difficulty when trying to watch youtube or read an interesting book is even worse - I can’t even enjoy my free time. At the same time, staying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality. I still get to see my friends, take classes, and at least experience what feels like 10% of a college experience.

I think it’s important to hold on to everything we can for as long as we can. Every year I’ve improved as a person: learning new things, meeting new people, etc. Last year, I ceased to tackle anything new, and simply held on to what I had built up over the years. I’m certainly not progressing anytime soon, but I refuse to digress if possible. (Granted, I’m likely not at the point you are. Soon, it might be impossible to even pass my classes. At that point, it seems like the no-knowledge lifestyle is the only option as you say.)

I would definitely encourage you to talk to your friends about it, if you’re still somewhat close with them. I also used excuses for why my grades started tanking - I used to just tell my friends that GPA didn’t matter much for CS so I didn’t care. By hiding the symptoms though, I stopped myself from getting advice from them, which has definitely turned out to be helpful. At the same, hiding your symptoms only makes it harder for people to believe once you finally reveal them.

I’m glad you’ve finally been able to find some explanations! Definitely keep us updated if you discover anything. What do you think you’re doing differently moving forward compared to the last few years?

Funny how you mention strategy games. Last year when it all started, I used to play chess daily against my roommate. I used it as a metric to see how the brain fog was improving. Eventually, I just stopped since I could never remember any strategy. He would use the same moves against me day after day and I just wouldn’t remember them.

I think it helps to latch onto something for motivation. My choice to study CS and Bio wasn’t completely random - after spending so much time with brain fog, I’ve come to realize how little is understood about it, and I’d love to change that. Once I get past this, I hope to at least help a few of the people on this sub.

I 100% contracted Lyme (was tested and treated immediately) when I was 13.

I was then tested again this year given my symptoms. I just looked back at these tests, and the only one for Lyme is called "Lyme AB Screen," which I assume isn't terribly specific. I will definitely look into more comprehensive testing.

What do you mean by "after it was too late?"

A lot of similarities here: I contracted Lyme when I was 13 (7 years ago) and started noticing mild cognitive decline when I was 15. (I don't actually remember contracting Lyme or getting treated or anything about it, I just remember that I missed soccer tryouts and didn't make the soccer team that year because of it)

After my symptoms severely worsened last year, I underwent several rounds of blood tests. Two of them included Lyme (I'm not sure which specific tests), but the results were negative. Do you think this definitely rules out Lyme, or is it still possible to have Lyme given negative results?

Heyo. I'm a 20 year old male, and I've been experiencing similar symptoms since I was 15. I'm also a very critical/logical thinker (I study CS and Bio). It's truly incredible how accurately your bowling ball example describes me. My symptoms were very minor at first and I was able to excel in high school, but the symptoms worsened exponentially last year after my fraternity's (very tame) "hell week." I simply wasn't able to recover from a week of disturbed sleep.

I'll try to come back to this and add more to this comment later, but in case I forget I want to at least say this:
It's absolutely brutal to have such a life-halting issue, especially since the issue itself wears down the critical/logical thinking mind you'd usually use to tackle it. The people around you probably won't understand your symptoms- they certainly don't for me. As each test comes back negative, the doctors won't have a fucking clue what's going on.

I'm sure you already know most of this, but basically I just want to say that you're not alone. Stay strong. If you ever want to talk, I'm sure there's a lot we can learn from each other's stories.

Edit: grammar errors from brain fog

If you decide to start gaming again, I'd recommend you find a short game with ~10-15 hours of gameplay. Test out whether you're able to play for only a few hours at a time, or whether you simply can't stop once you start.

You won't run the risk of getting sucked into the game and ruining the life you've built - if you get sucked in, the game will be over before you know it. Then, you can decide it simply isn't possible to play games casually.

Edit: Personally, I agree with you. I find it impossible to play games for an hour at a time. It's hardly enjoyable to game in such small doses. When I play games, I have to set aside literal days to do nothing but just play. Once those days are up, I stop completely and don't play again for a few weeks. This solution works for me, but as you said, it's still playing with fire

3 biggest things that help me on exams:

1) Have a list of the major topic categories: BFS/DFS, SCC/Kosaraju/toposort, MST, shortest paths, greedy algs. It's safe to assume there will be roughly one question from each category. If you're stuck on a question, see which of these categories you haven't encountered yet

2) Have a list of common runtimes and the algorithms associated with those runtimes. See O(m+n) on question 1a)? List out BFS/DFS/toposort/Kosaraju's and see if any of those help you.

3) Know the in's and out's of each algorithm's runtime: Why is Kruskal's O(m log m)? Knowing the runtime specifics, how does this change if the edges are already sorted? When you see a question like 1b) you can notice how it's similar to Bellman Ford and, understanding the origin of the VE runtime, manipulate the alg to fit the constraints

Granted, I did pretty poorly on this exam too, so take my advice with a grain of salt

I'm a bit late but...
I had a pretty similar schedule my first semester (same thing but I had writing sem and ECON 001 instead of ESE and music). It was definitely tough, but manageable.

If you want, you can switch one of your math/engineering courses for something easier, but if you plan on doing EE and CIS then this is a pretty standard semester in terms of difficulty

Nice haul!
I've also been thinking about flipping iPods when I see them, but I was unsure if I'd be locked out of the iPod without the proper account. Has this ever been an issue for you?

An eBay buyer sent me an offer, to which I sent a counteroffer, and then they bought the item. For whatever reason, they were charged the original price rather than the counteroffer price.

The buyer wants me to send the difference directly to their PayPal. Is it ok to do this?

Read the beginner's guide last week and went to my first garage sale this weekend:


HP Officejet Pro 8500 printer - loaded w/ ink and w/ extra cartridges for $25 ($75-$100) 

Linksys AC1200 max wifi extender for $5 ($60)

RobotiKits super solar racing car for $1 ($8)

Mighty mouse 1966 cartoon movie for $1 ($10)

Sony watchman for free ($8)

Three CoD/Halo games for $3 each ($7-10 each)


The estimates are based off previously sold ebay listings.
Thanks for the help!

Just curious, what kinds of items do you all usually flip from garage sales?

I know this probably varies, but any tips for things I should keep an eye out for? I'll be going to a few for the first time this weekend.

"Due the first working day in January after the winter break"

Wouldn't "after winter break" imply that grades would be returned on the 11th?
